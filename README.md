A simple webpage that counts the number of times that you press a button.

This is a simple project with the purpose of familiarising myself with React. The idea is that this project will give me some experience with setting up and installing React, giving me a starting point for further experimentation.

This project is the creation of Andrew Farmer, and the tutorial can be found at www.andrewhfarmer.com/build-your-own-starter


Instructions:

1. Use this command to start the server:

	npm start

2. Use this command to setup npm

	npm install

3. Use this command to compile

	npm run compile

4. Access http://localhost:3000.



5. Press the button and (hopefully) watch the count increase.
